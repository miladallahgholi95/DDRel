*******************************  Abstract  ******************************

Analyzing the relationships among various drugs is an important issue in the field of computational biology.
Different kinds of informative knowledge such as drug repurposing can be extracted from drug-drug relationships.
Scientific literature represents a rich source for the retrieval of knowledge about the relationships between
biological concepts, mainly drug-drug, disease-disease and drug-disease relationships. In this paper, we propose DDREL
as a general purpose method that applis deep learning on scientific literature to automatically extract the graph of
syntactic and semantic relationships among drugs. DDREL remarkably outperformed the existing human drug network 
method and random network built 100 times with respect to average similarities of drugsâ€™ anatomical therapeutic
chemical (ATC) codes. As an application, DDREL succeeded to discover repurposing drugs with 81% accuracy.
